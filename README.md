In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this unit. The app take's in orders from customers and deplete's stock from the store's inventory. Using the mysql, and inquirer NPM packages I was able to accomplish this task. When you start the application it shows you a list of the store's products and how many are available, then it ask's you which item you would like to buy and how many of that item. After completing the inquirer prompts it deducts the amout of the product you needed from the available stock quantity.
