In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I learned this unit. The app take's in orders from customers and deplete's stock from the store's inventory. Using the mysql, and inquirer NPM packages I was able to accomplish this task. When you start the application it shows you a list of the store's products and how many are available, then it ask's you which item you would like to buy and how many of that item. After completing the inquirer prompts it deducts the amout of the product you needed from the available stock quantity.

When you run the node application it gives you this in the console log.

Then it ask's you what item you would like to purchase and how many.

After that it deducts the amount you asked for and redisplays the inventory list.

And if there is not enough of that particular order left it lets you know.
